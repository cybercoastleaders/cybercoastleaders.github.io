# What is this?

Every Tuesday at 7:30 we will jump on a call and help each other as entrepreneurs.

## The Cyber Coast Vision

Everyone here should aim at paying it forward, as VCs, to other founders by 2040.  We're building success stories, an ecosystem, and accessible know-how so that this area is the silicon valley of the east, the Cyber Coast.

## Format

Depending on numbers and feedback we'll do 3 rounds and 1 hot-seat.  In a round we each answer the question but minimize cross-talk.  We'll try to keep this brief, while maximizing benefit and accountability.  If the format can be improved let me know.

# Question 1: 

First-timer: Where are you on your journey to VC by 2040?

Returning: What progress did you make since last week?

# Question 2: 

What one thing will you do this week that will maximize your progress on that journey?

# Question 3: 

Give some advice, a reference, a contact, or some insight you think will be beneficial to the someone you heard speak today.

# The Hot-Seat:

One member gets the spotlight, states an opportunity they are working on that they would like to examine.  The other members drill in with questions to help bring out other perspectives, hidden assumptions, etc.
